# HikingTrails
This app will find Hiking Trails within a given area that you specify.
The app uses two APIs.
The Census.gov API is used to take the users address and return the Lat. and Long. of the address.
The Hiking Project API takes the Lat. and Long. , and distance entered. Then will return the hiking trails based upon that information.
